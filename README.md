# Angular TicTacToe Challenge

As I felt the disturb in the Force by the prank of this challenge ðŸ˜œ, the game
actually does:

- Checks if a clear winner has emerged and disables player's moves
- Checks if a no-win situation has occurred
- Disables the "current player" message and enables the "new game button" if one
  of the previous occurs
